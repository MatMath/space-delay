## Space Delay

Too often we hear project X is late, Y is late, Z is late again... but human are really bad as stats and we only remember pointy thing. So I wanted to visualize real data and see by How much and what happened.

### But... why? 
Because... I was bored of working on my main project so I had fun one evening. Also, I just wanted to play with some graph. :P. 

### `npm start`

Business as usual.
